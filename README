## OBML - Object-Based Markup Language

I've been thinking about this idea recently.
What if HTML could be shorter?
What if HTML is type-safe?
What if HTML looks like a JavaScript Object?

That's why I'm building OBML. I'm creating this just as a fun little interesting project. I don't intend for it to be the "NEXT BIG TREND" or whatever though it would be really cool if that happens (it won't lol).

I'm not sure the direction this is going yet but...let's start with a single JavaScript file.
